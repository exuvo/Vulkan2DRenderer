///				however it enables a lot of flexibility in the host application. You can also
///				blur the render target texture at the end of its rendering operation.
///				Render target texture is primarily meant for realtime use where you re-render
///				it each frame (and thus it also uses a fair bit of memory as it is
///				double-buffered), however you do not need to re-render it each frame, just
///				re-render it whenever the contents of the render target texture change.
///				You can of course render to a render target texture only once in it's
///				lifetime and just use it like a regular texture throughout the application,
///				however in this situation, if you can, you should instead create a
///				vk2d::TextureResource.
