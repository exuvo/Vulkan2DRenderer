/// @brief		vk2d::FontResource is a resource that can be loaded with vk2d::ResourceManager.
///				It is needed for printing text in the realtime scene / window.
///				To use a font to print text in the window you'll first need to load the
///				font from a disk, then generate text mesh using the font resource, then
///				finally render the text mesh to a window or render target texture using
///				either vk2d::Window::DrawMesh() or vk2d::RenderTargetTexture::DrawMesh() functions.

	/// @brief		This constructor is meant for internal use only. All resources are
	///				created from vk2d::ResourceManager only.
	/// @note		Multithreading: Any thread, selected managed by vk2d::ResourceManager.
	/// @param[in]	resource_manager
	///				Pointer to resource manager implementation object responsible for
	///				creating this resource.
	/// @param[in]	loader_thread_index
	///				Index to thread pool thread index. Tells which thread pool thread
	///				is responsible for creation and destruction of the internal data
	///				of this resource.
	/// @param[in]	parent_resource
	///				Pointer to a resource that owns this resource. Resources can have
	///				parent and child resources, this is just used to keep track of
	///				resources that are used by other resources and should not be removed
	///				unless the parent resources are removed.
	/// @param[in]	file_path
	///				File path where to load the font resource from.
	/// @param[in]	glyph_texel_size
	///				Glyph texel size tells the desired nominal height of a single letter
	///				in pixels/texels, however you should keep in mind that this value is
	///				only a guideline, the actual size will vary from font to font and a
	///				lot depends on what the font creator decided. Testing is the only way
	///				to know for sure.
	///				Since it's easy to scale the text at render time, this could be used
	///				as the quality of the letters, though for the perfect results you
	///				should use 1:1 texel mapping from the font to the window where you
	///				want the letters to be rendered to. ( that is to say, for perfect
	///				results use scale 1.0, 1.0 when rendering the text and use this
	///				parameter to control the size. )
	/// @param[in]	use_alpha
	///				Use alpha channel instead of color on edge of the letters when rendering.
	/// @param[in]	fallback_character
	///				Which character to use when desired character was not found in the
	///				font resource, eg. <B>&Delta;</B> might not appear on all fonts, so
	///				instead we use another in it's place.
	/// @param[in]	glyph_atlas_padding
	///				Font glyphs (Letters, numbers, markings) are internally stored in
	///				a texture atlas for efficiency, however if you render the text much
	///				smaller than the actual size of the glyphs in the texture atlas,
	///				mipmapping is often used to make text appear less grainy. However
	///				if mipmapping is used, then the glyphs may eventually start to mix
	///				together in the final render, to decrease the amount of this
	///				"UV bleeding" you can increase the gap between glyphs in the texture
	///				atlas here.
